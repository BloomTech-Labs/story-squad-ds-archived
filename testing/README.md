## Testing Directions

Included here:

- a script for converting images to base64 and saving that in a `.txt` file - `test_1.py`
- 4 test images of short handwritten sentences
- 4 `.txt` files that were generated by `test_1.py`
- a `.json` template for creating more test files if needed
- 4 `.json` test files including the base64 from the `.txt` files

To run the tests navigate to the root `story-squad-ds` folder:

```python
pipenv run python dotPy/transcription.py < testing/test_pic_1.json
```
