## Testing Directions

- download the StorySquad dataset (contact project stakeholder for access)
- set `path` in `json_converter.py` equal to wherever it's located on your personal machine
- set `path_2` in `json_converter.py` equal to wherever you'd like to store the generated JSON objects
- from `story-squad-ds/testing` run `python test.py` in terminal
  - if error, make sure your paths are set correctly
