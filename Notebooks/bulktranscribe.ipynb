I, on the other hand, did not want this,   but my father did not care. At all.    Now I was feeling I had been abandoned    to get a silly prize my father wanted to    brag about. I hated it. But now, I felt   an anser; one that filled up with a   desire to capture Sleth, and to prove   to my father that I was better than  being abandoned. But I decided that I   Should prove my worth to the Asterians   by helping them with their own   problems. After all, Sleth was not    bothering them. []      Page 2                   5220  So, for the next ten years, my father   didn\\'t hear a single word from me.    I kept on helping each Asterian,   going from door to door, day and night.  I helped each family out with their   biggest struggle, in exchange for   a promise: don\\'t tell the king anything.   After the ten years, I came back   to the palace, to the same door that   I had gotten kicked out from.   I knocked on the door, and 2 seconds    later, a guard came. When he saw    me, he stared. Slowly, his eyes widened    when he realized who was standing    there. He called for the king to    come, and all of a sudden, I saw   my father but in a different way from   10 years ago. His hair was turning   gray, he had more wrinkles. But I   didn\\'t care. Despite all of the   resentment from 10 years ago, I hugged    him with all my might. I still loved    him, even if he had kicked me out.    He was right, though. I did need    the Astenians respect, and by those     10 years, I think I earned theirs.     But my father\\'s response was not []       Page 3                    5220  what I thought it would be.   \"Where\\'s Sleth?\" he asked.   Apparently he didn\\'t care if I    was here or not. But when I    explained what had happened, his    scowl at the beginning of my    explination slowly turned into a     chuckle at the end.       \"I\\'m amazed. You earned the   Astenians respect, like I told you   too,\" he said. \"Even though you   did not capture Sleth, you still have   my respect. You did a great job.\"     I stood there, so happy I was     paralyzed. I had did it. I had earned     my father\\'s respect.      [illstration]',\n",

Today, he  is a full-grown diamond-back dragon, but way-back-when, he started as an egg with a height of 6  inches, and a width of 5 inches. It started when I was 5 years old, wandering on my own in the trade  market. A young woman ran up to me, a scared, and ashen look on her face. Through her black veil, she said  \"Keep this safe,\" and ran away. In my hand was Larson\\'s egg. It was snaking, as if it was  trembling with fear. So I took it home, and set it on the wooden floor of the room I shared with  my four brothers. A silver snout had poked a hole in the egg, and part of a white eggshell  had littered the floor. So I picked it up and hid the egg under the loose floorboard in the  ground so that nobody could find it. I was a very sneeky child when I was little, and I  still am. \"Ruelind Pine! Get down here! We are going to start supper without you!\" Shouted  my mother in her hoarse voice. She had gotten ill after Gill, my youngest brother, had been              older born, so my ^ brothers made supper. Most of the time, meals were dried fruit, and if we were  lucky, meat my brothers hunted down. But I was starving from today\\'s hard labor, so I  didn\\'t dare miss another one of the meals.

What I saw was a mess of egg shells, a dragon  and my oldest brother, Pan. That is how we formed an agreement to keep the dragon a  secret, and accidentaly letting the dragon out years after by leaving the window open.  Now we are back in the present, I am 12 years old, my brother is 18. We  are running in the woods chasing after Larson who is happily breathing fire, taking  down trees [] building. That is also how I set a trap and captured Larson  (using food).',\n",

My  father had told me to got one of the  younger puppies so I could watch   him or her grow. My little sister  was so taken by this young puppy that  was bouncing around her feet. I didn\\'t  care. I wanted Bosco. My mother supported  me in my decision. She would always  support me.     \"Lelina,\" She would say, \"when the world  falls apart and no one is there anymore,  know that I will be there. I\\'ll stand on  your side when everyone on Earth is  against you. And when the choice comes,  your father and sister will too.\"     The only problem was that she wasn\\'t  here anymore. She was gone. My world had  gone with her.     We drove home that fateful day and  opened the front door. Bosco ran in and raced  through every room. We chased after him  screaming, \"Bosco! Bosco come back!\" He  didn\\'t listen.     We had decided on the name in the  car. Bosco just seemed so natural.  5130 #2 I looked at Bosco and the first thing that  came to mind was Bosco. I don\\'t know  why.     We finally caught up to Bosco in the  living room. We encompassed him and slowly  started moving around, making our circle  tighter. That\\'s when it happened.     When I think back, it seems like a fairytale  sort of thing. Something that only happens in   those stories, but not in real life. Bosco  jumped onto the couch and leaped onto our low  hanging chandelier. How did he even do  that? He was supposed to be Old!     As soon as Bosco got onto the chandelier,  he ran, beginning to loosen it. We all backed  away but my mother was too late....  Apparently there wasnt a lot holding our  chandelier into the ceiling.     It fell. Right on top of my mom. The  seconds in which the chandelier   was falling I hoped and prayed that my  mother would run, but she and I both  knew that there wasn\\'t enough time.  She looked at me and mouthed, \"I will always  be there.\" And then she died. I was  oblivious to the scream that escaped  my lips and the tears pouring down  my face.  5130 #3    The funeral was horrible. We   burned her, because that was what  she had always wanted. Instead  of having her ashes kept, she had  wanted to be spread across the fields,  so she could live with nature.  Thats what we did. The only thing  I had left of her was a picture  Of the whole family at the state fair.     I guess I did come to terms with  mother\\'s death. Bosco helped me  the most, because after a while, I realized  that my mother had wanted Bosco too, making  him another thing my mother had left  me.     My father had wanted to get rid  of Bosco. \"Stupid dog,\" he said, \"Killed  my wife.\"     I didn\\'t let him. I explained my [] him and he grudgingly agreed. Secretly,  I think that Bosco helped Father too.  He really is a sweet dog.  In the end, everything turned out okay. I  believe my mother got what she wanted in life.  I\\'m happy if she\\'s happy. She was happy  so I am happy. My mother was right.  In a way, when I feel the worst, I  feel her presence.

It wasn\\'t fair. I never  have birthday parties. He gets them all. When I  try to tell my parents they say, \"He is only four. Give  it a break.\"     While he is only four I am ten. Later  on I realized that this was the least of my problems.  Let me tell you want happened on my tenth  birthday.     My brother woke me up when the sun started  coming up. It was torture. Every year he sings this  song to wake me up and it is so annoying.   \"Shut Up!\" I told him.     \"Do you want me to tell on you?\" he  asked.     \"I don\\'t care just shut up!\" I replied.  So he went.     \"Daddy!!\"     I decided not to listen. After all I didn\\'t care.  Instead I tried my best to go back to sleep. I  couldn\\'t. So I got up and saw only my dad.  \" Hey dad,\" I said, \"where\\'s Mom?\" Dad didn\\'t  even hear me because he was to busy  playing and jumping around singing the  annoying song with my brother So, I assumed Mom   5129  just went to do some last minute shopping.  I went to the kitchen to get myself some  cereal when I heard an ear piercing scream.     \" What happened?\" I yelled.

Of course that  was not true. Why did he get tickets if there were   only two left?     While my brother was opening gifts, there were  none for me cause Dad said they didn\\'t know what  to get, I was watching TV all by myself just like  always.     When my dad and brother went to  see the baseball game my mom came home.     \"How\\'s your birthday so far ?\" asked my mom.     \"What do you think?\" I answered, \"Nothing  special has happened. It feels like any other  day.\"     \"Well I am about to make it better.\"  said my mom.     My mom picked up a box she brought  in with her. At first I didn\\'t notice it. I thought  it was more gifts for my brother, but then it started  moving. 5129     \"What\\'s in the box?\" I asked. She  didn\\'t reply. She opened it and out came  a puppy.     \"What!\" I said.     From then on I never complained about  my brother.',\n",

[] Just like that my life changed.  I spent three horible years with  Percy. He would always hit me if he  did not get some where on time.     One day I decided to go  on a ride by myself. Just as I was  leaving I saw Steve coming in  with the same green peice of  paper I saw 3 years ago.     Once again I was riding of the  edge of a cliff with Steve.',\n",
